# PinTrip

PinTrip is a mashup of Pinterest and Flickr to help users create photo boards for their next trip.
Users can create/remove their own personalized 'trip board' for each city they are interested in visiting.
After a board has been created, users can search for photos with geotags in the chosen city and add/remove them to/from the trip board.
Users can also use the explore feature to look at trip boards created by other uses. 
The favorites option allows a user to save other boards into their list of favorites for inspiration.
The user preferences are saved in the database and users can revisit and modify their trips, maps, favorites at any given time.
Once the trip board is complete, users can view a map of their trip which pins all of the favorite photo locations.
